- **Advanced Search**: Search by sector, project maturity, location
- **Events Calendar**: Conferences, pitch sessions, and workshops

### üîß Admin Area  
- **Admin Back Office**: Management of projects, startups, and users
- **Dashboard**: Statistics on project visibility and user interactions
- **Content Management**: Adding, editing, and deleting project profiles
- **User Management**: Role assignment (administrators, startups, privileged visitors)

### üöÄ Startup Area
- **Startup Profile**: Creation and update of project profiles
- **Internal Messaging**: Communication between startups and investors  
- **Opportunity Tracking**: Access to funding opportunities and project calls

## Technical Stack

### Frontend
- *To be determined by team*
- Requirements: Responsive design, accessibility compliance, modern web standards

### Backend  
- *To be determined by team*
- Requirements: API integration, CRUD operations, data synchronization

### Database
- *To be determined by team*  
- Requirements: Full CRUD support, data relationships, performance optimization

## Team Structure

- **Morgan**: CI/CD + GitHub Projects (+ Maquettage when possible)
- **Hugo/Kilian/Swan**: Maquettage (UI/UX Design)
- **Backend Development**: API integration, database management
- **Frontend Development**: Responsive UI implementation
- **Testing**: Functional, unit, and behavior testing
- **Documentation**: Technical and user documentation

## Development Workflow

### Communication Formats
- **Daily Standups**: Focus only on what's being done each day
- **Evening Debriefs**: End-of-day reviews (not morning)
- **Email Communications**: Document and track important communications

### Task Types
1. **Theorycraft UI-UX**: Maquettage, styling reflection
2. **Frontend Development**: UI implementation
3. **Backend Development**: Auth, API calls, data management
4. **Testing**: Functional, unit, behavior tests
5. **CI/CD**: Automate norm testing, unit tests, functional tests
6. **Documentation**: Technical and user guides

## Technical Constraints & Requirements

### API Integration
- Integrate with existing incubator API for data migration
- Implement own backend with full CRUD functionality
- Regular synchronization between old and new systems
- Seamless transition from existing data to new platform

### Responsive Design
- Must work on all devices and screen sizes
- Accessibility compliance required
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Modern web standards implementation

### Data Management
